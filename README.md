# AI Image Generator using MERN Stack
Welcome to my AI Image Generator project built using the MERn stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js).
This is a full-stack project that utilizes artificial intelligence to generate images based on user inputs, similar to OpenAI's DALL-E. 

# Project Overview
The AI Image Generator is a web application that allows users to generate unique images based on a combination of text inputs
and pre-defined image styles. The application uses a deep learning model that has been trained on a large dataset of images to 
generate new images that match the user's input. The generated images can be downloaded or shared via social media.

# Features
The AI Image Generator comes with the following features:

User-friendly interface that allows users to easily input their text and select their desired image style.
Integration with a deep learning model to generate unique images based on user inputs.
Ability to download or share generated images via social media.
Secure user authentication and authorization system to protect user data.
Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices

# Technologies Used
The AI Image Generator is built using the following technologies:

MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store user data and image styles.
Express.js: A server-side web application framework used to build the API endpoints for the application.

React: A client-side JavaScript library used to build the user interface of the application.

Node.js: A server-side JavaScript runtime used to run the API endpoints for the application.
